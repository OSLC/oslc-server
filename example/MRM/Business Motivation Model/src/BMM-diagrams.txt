// There's also a need for a means of depicting the sub-projects, services, outputs, outcomes, needs and target groups
// These hierarchies should be shown using nested symbols on diagrams, but referential consistency and containment associations
// using nested symbols isn't supported (yet). For now we'll leave out these associations and users can manually place
// sub-items inside their parent symbols if desired. This will avoid creating a lot of lines that we'll want to remove later

// We use one line to depict all implicit relationships between node on the diagram.

// property name or relation name on the line to distinguish the different relationships
// Use display mode to select what to display on the line

// and_subtypes might only refer to the to-end, not the from-end

// These are also all the relations that would need to be defined
// But they are only defined in one direction, so the user will not be able 
// to create the relationship from either direction.
