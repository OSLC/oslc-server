// The following BMM placeholders are not implemented in BMM,

// BMM Liability --> N/A
// BMM Offering --> N/A
// BMM Organization Unit --> TOGAF9::Organization Unit

// BMM Resource --> N/A - Entity, MRM Resource are possibilities


// Explicit Relationships: used for relationships with properties, relationships that have associations with
// other relationships, or relationships that are represented by line and/or node symbols
// There are no relationship definitions in BMM, all relationships are simple properties

// BMM relation names:
// Relation names make queries, lines on explorer diagrams, and metamodel diagrams more meaningful
// Pick the relation to be the primary direction: source relation target, target relationInverse source
// That way a single line can be used to create the relationship and it will be pointing in the right direction,
// created from the source the user will find most common or typical

// These relation names should probably also be prefixed with BMM to create a namespace in order to 
// avoid collitions with relations from other metamodel extensions. But We'll defer this for now 

// See section 9.5 of the OMG BMM specification for the orgin of the relation names and assocated property names
// The SA Explorer view expands definitions to see their related properties. Only the relation definitions are shown,
// the inverse relation is not displayed. 
// The relation is therefore chosen based on the preferred navigability, with the inverse appearing to be non-navigable in the Explorer
