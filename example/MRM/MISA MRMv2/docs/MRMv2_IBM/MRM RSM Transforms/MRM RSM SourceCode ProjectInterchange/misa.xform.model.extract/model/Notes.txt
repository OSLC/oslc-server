If the 'extract.xsd' schema changes, you can 'reload' the genmodel, however, some settings
are lost in the ecore and genmodel files.

After reloading, make sure that the following properties of the first child of the
model are set as shown.

	Extract.ecore
		Name = Extract
		Ns Prefix = Extract
		Ns Uri = http://misa/extract.xsd
		
	extract.genmodel
		Base Package = misa.xform.model
		Prefix = Extract
